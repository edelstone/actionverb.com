## About The Native Speaker Program

The Native Speaker program is a special job opportunity at Action Verb
available to bilingual people who speak fluent English, as well as one
of the following languages:

 * Danish
 * Dutch
 * French
 * Japanese
 * Italian
 * Portuguese (Brazil)
 * Russian
 * Swedish

It is a major plus to live in the main country that speaks your native
language, and it is required for you to at least be in a similar
timezone to that country.


### Responsibilities

Here are some of the things you'll be doing as a Native Speaker at
Action Verb:

 * You'll translate our web applications and marketing materials into
 your native language.

 * You'll answer phone calls and emails from current customers and
prospects in your native language, working with our Sales and Customer
Success departments to give the caller the same great service they'd
have received if they spoke English.

 * You'll help us make decisions about targeted advertising and sales in your
native language with your local knowledge.

### Qualifications

We are looking for candidates who bring the following skills to the
table:

 * Perfect phone demeanor and ability to communicate effectively via the phone.
 * Perfect grammar and professional tone via email.
 * Understanding of the technical and engineering aspects of hosting.
 * Ability to smoothly transition between Sales and Support functions.
 * Desire to work in a fast-paced startup environment where if something
 you need doesn't exist, you are expected to build it!

Our hosting products are not your normal run-of-the-mill hosting
products.  Vae Platform is highly customized CMS hosting (think
Squarespace or Shopify) and BrickFTP is entirely focused on file sharing
(think Box.com or Dropbox).  With that said, we still want to see a
hosting-centric skillset when we hire for Native Speakers.

The hosting-related body of knowledge we want you to have or be
able to learn quickly includes:

 * TCP/IP and understanding of IP routing
 * DNS
 * FTP
 * HTTP
 * Email (including IMAP, POP, SMTP)
 * Firewalls and Ports
 * SSL/TLS
 * UNIX or Linux experience
 * PHP/MySQL or similar coding experience

Most of our best applicants have Computer Science (or similar) degrees
from a well-regarded university.  **Our best applicants also tend
to have at least 3-5 years experience** in a position with direct
responsibility for supporting hosting clients or other servers that
are used in a production environment.

## Some of our Core Beliefs

**We believe that recruiting and hiring top talent is very hard.** Our success depends on finding the best people out there, so we've invested heavily in our recruiting and interviewing processes. Making our next hire even better than the last is one of our highest priorities.

**We believe that allowing and supporting 100% remote work gives us
access to great people we wouldn't otherwise be able to hire.**  We tend
to hire folks who are later in their careers, which means they usually
have their family established somewhere.  By offering remote work, we
can hire the best people, no matter where they're located.

**We believe that the best way we can acquire top talent is by being an
amazing place to work.**  Work from home, travel with the team, and
surround yourself with top tier people at Action Verb.

**We believe in building products that we actually use ourselves.** We are
our own toughest critics and we put all of our products through their
paces every day.
