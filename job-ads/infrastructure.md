## Our Core Beliefs

**We believe that everyone in the company should have
programming skills.** Our customers are primarily engineers, and in order
to relate to them and support our products at the highest possible
level, we should all be engineers too.  As a Sysadmin/DevOps engineer,
you will spend a lot of time writing code here.

**We believe that the best Engineers tend to be polyglots with a wide
variety of programming language experience.** We don’t care whether you
specifically know Puppet or Chef, but we look for engineers who are
fluent in several programming languages. We want our staff to be
adaptable and ready to evolve to what’s next.

**We believe that allowing and supporting 100% remote work gives us
access to great people we wouldn't otherwise be able to hire.**  We tend
to hire folks who are later in their careers, which means they usually
have their family established somewhere.  By offering remote work, we
can hire the best people, no matter where they're located.

**We believe that the best way we can acquire top talent is by being an
amazing place to work.**  Work from home, travel with the team, and
surround yourself with top tier people at Action Verb.

working at Action Verb great.](https://actionverb.com/working-at-action-verb)

**We believe that building great infrastructure and platform products
requires a great internal infrastructure.** We have over 150,000 metrics,
real-time service monitoring, fully searchable logs, and full
configuration management via Chef.  We built our own application deployment system.

**We believe in using the right tool for the job.** Our core DevOps stack includes
AWS, Chef, ELK, Grafana, Statsd, Asterisk, Capistrano, MySQL, Redis,
Memcached, Zeromq, Jenkins, Github, Honeybadger, and many other exciting open source
systems. We don’t want to get stuck in the trap of using a language or a
tool just because "that’s how it’s done around here."

**We believe that open-source only works if companies give back.**  If you
work on any open-source projects during the course of your work at
Action Verb, you are encouraged to submit your improvements as a pull
request back to the upstream project.  And if you build something from
scratch while working here that’s generic and not related to our core
products, we want you to release that on GitHub too.  We’ll also pay
your travel costs to any conference where you can get a speaking gig.

**We believe that our DevOps Engineers are the first line of defense
when something bad happens.** You will be on call 24/7 (except for your
20 days per year of vacation) in case there are performance problems in production.
Fortunately, afterhours callouts are rare for us.

**We believe in building products that we actually use ourselves.** We are
our own toughest critics and we put all of our products through their
paces every day.

 production?  How many servers?  If Cloud based, how many
 regions/clouds? What automation tools did you rely on
 to manage such a big network?

 Software and are there any repositories that you maintain personally?

You may also want to write about why this opportunity calls to you
personally and why you see yourself as a good fit for Action Verb.  We
