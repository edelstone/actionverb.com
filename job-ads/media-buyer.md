## Some of Our Core Beliefs

**We believe that everyone in the company should have coding
skills.** We want everyone here to be able to take action to get things
done.  Adding JavaScript tracking code to a page shouldn't scare you.
If you need to implement your own click and converstion tracking on
a platform that doesn't provide it natively, you should be able to do
so.

**We believe that allowing and supporting 100% remote work gives us
access to great people we wouldn't otherwise be able to hire.**  We tend
to hire folks who are later in their careers, which means they usually
have their family established somewhere.  By offering remote work, we
can hire the best people, no matter where they're located.

**We believe that the best way we can acquire top talent is by being an
amazing place to work.**  Work from home, travel with the team, and
surround yourself with top tier people at Action Verb.

**We believe that the things Cialdini writes about in Influence really
do make a difference.** There is art to marketing, but it is mostly a
science.  The process has been well studied and documented.  If you're
the right candidiate for this job, you'll be well-studied on the art and
science of driving paid traffic.

## Ready To Apply?

Working here isn't for everyone, but if you think it might be for you and you have the required experience, **please apply**.

The link below will take you to our applicant tracking system, which
asks for a lot of information.  However, the only field we will read at
first is the box that says "Cover Letter."

At Action Verb, we look for results, so our initial screening round
starts by reviewing your results as a Media Buyer / Paid Traffic
Manager.

We'd like to to write a cover letter and paste it into that box.  Please make sure
that it contains all of the following information about your level of experience:

 * How much spend (in dollars) have you personally managed in online media or PPC spend?  Personally managed means that you were the one logging in to Adwords, Facebook, etc. and managing the campaigns yourself.

 * For how much spend (in dollars) out of the above amount did you also write the ad copy and/or create the image or video creative?

 * On a Scale of 1 to 10, how much do you know and understand about the Facebook and Adwords platforms?  A 1 means you've never used the platform, and a 10 means you could probably run their customer service department right now if offered.

You may also want to write about why this opportunity calls to you
personally and why you see yourself as a good fit for Action Verb.  We
also love watching Video Cover Letters, so feel free to post a YouTube
or Vimeo link into the box in lieu of a written letter.
