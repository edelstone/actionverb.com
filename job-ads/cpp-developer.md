At Action Verb, we look for results, so our initial screening round
starts by reviewing your previous results as a coder or engineer.  The
more you can help us understand that, the better.

We'd like to to write a cover letter and paste it into that box.  Please make sure
that it contains all of the following information about your level of experience:

 * What is the largest Qt cross-platform application you have personally worked on where
 your code is currently in widespread use?  How many clients run it, and can
 you share any other information about the scale at which it is being
 used?

 * What is the largest contribution you have made to Open Source
 Software and are there any repositories that you maintain personally?

 * On a Scale of 1 to 10, please rate your knowledge of data structures,
 algorithms, and writing code that will scale.

You may also want to write about why this opportunity calls to you
personally and why you see yourself as a good fit for Action Verb.  We
also love watching Video Cover Letters, so feel free to post a YouTube
or Vimeo link into the box in lieu of a written letter.
