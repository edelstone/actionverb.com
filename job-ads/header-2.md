There are no assistants, subordinates, or committees here.  You will
know your authority and accountabilities, and take action.

Roles are created, changed, and removed as our business grows, and the
roles you fill as an employee will evolve over time.

*&quot;Most startups believe in iteration of their
products. Now they need to apply the same thinking to their
organizations.&quot;<br />&ndash; Adam Pisoni, Yammer co-founder & CTO*

You will attend a 4-day onboarding course we've designed to teach you the
in's and out's of how this all works.  By the end of your onboarding,
you'll be more equipped to get things actually accomplished, deployed,
and implemented at Action Verb than you have ever been at a previous
employer.

### We Are A Remote Company

You will work from home and have some flexibility to choose your
working hours, allowing you to make time for family, recreation,
vacations, or anything that is important to you.

You'll take off 11 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20
days of PTO for vacations.  Go have fun.  Don't work all the time.

Every quarter, you'll travel to an in-person meeting with the entire
teami to meet and work together face to face.  These meetings are in
cities that are fun to visit.  In the last few years, we've been to
Austin, Orlando, Phoenix, San Diego, Las Vegas, and New York City.


## Results-Based Hiring

Action Verb approaches recruiting like a major-league sports team.
Just like a team in the NFL or NBA has only a limited number of picks in the
draft, we only have a small number of slots available for new employees,
and we want to maximize the chance that the people we draft have the
highest possible chance of producing results for the team.

To further the sports analogy, getting a job at Action Verb starts with
your stats.

When we need to fill a role, we look for people with a track record of
success filling a similar role.

When we need to fill a role, we look for people with a track record of
success filling a similar role.  We do not hire interns, junior staff,
or anyone with less than 3 years of experience directly related to the
role. As a result, all your co-workers will be major-league players, and
you will relate to everyone here as a peer.
