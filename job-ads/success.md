## Customer Success (Support) Engineer For {{ site.team_size }}-Person All-Remote SaaS Company

{% include_relative header-1.md %}
{% include_relative header-2.md %}

### For The Role of Customer Success, We Want To See This Track Record of Results:

 * Perfect phone demeanor and ability to communicate effectively via the phone.
 * Perfect grammar and professional tone via email.
 * Understanding of the technical and engineering aspects of hosting.
 * Ability to smoothly transition between Sales and Support functions.
 * Interest in taking on additional roles within the Company and a commitment to growing your capabilities.

Our hosting products are not your normal run-of-the-mill hosting
products.  Vae Platform is highly customized CMS hosting (think
Squarespace or Shopify) and BrickFTP is entirely focused on file sharing
(think Box.com or Dropbox).  With that said, we still want to see a
hosting-centric skillset when we hire for Sales/Support Engineer.

The hosting-related body of knowledge we want you to have includes:

 * TCP/IP and understanding of IP routing
 * DNS
 * FTP
 * HTTP
 * Email (including IMAP, POP, SMTP)
 * Firewalls and Ports
 * SSL/TLS
 * UNIX or Linux experience
 * PHP/MySQL or similar coding experience

Most of our best applicants have Computer Science (or similar) degrees
from a well-regarded university.  **Our best applicants also tend
to have at least 3-5 years experience** in a position with direct
responsibility for supporting hosting clients or other servers that
are used in a production environment.

This position is designed to appeal to engineers who know their stuff
technically but would rather their time be spent talking to real people
instead of buried inside a text editor working on code.  We don't expect
you to be an amazing engineer, but you should see yourself as an
engineer.

## Our Core Beliefs

**We believe that everyone in the company should have programming
skills.** Our customers are primarily engineers, and in order to
relate to them and support our products at the highest possible level,
we should all be engineers too.

**We believe that allowing and supporting 100% remote work gives us
access to great people we wouldn't otherwise be able to hire.**  We tend
to hire folks who are later in their careers, which means they usually
have their family established somewhere.  By offering remote work, we
can hire the best people, no matter where they're located.

**We believe that the best way we can acquire top talent is by being an
amazing place to work.**  Work from home, travel with the team, and
surround yourself with top tier people at Action Verb.

working at Action Verb great.](https://actionverb.com/working-at-action-verb)

**We believe that building great infrastructure and platform products
requires a great internal infrastructure.** We have Continuous Integration,
a full staging environment, and considerable test coverage.
We built our own application deployment system.  We
self-manage our server environment on Amazon Web Services and custom hardware.

**We believe that engineers should support what they build.** We expect
our teammates to take responsibility for the engineering decisions they
make.  If there are performance problems in production, nobody should
have to chase anyone down.  All engineers participate in a 24/7 on-call
rotation and all engineers speak to customers.

**We believe in building products that we actually use ourselves.** We are
our own toughest critics and we put all of our products through their
paces every day.
