**Back-end/Full-Stack Engineer (Ruby, Java, C++, and others) For Holacracy-Powered 11-Person All-Remote Engineer-Founded IaaS Company**

Hi!  We're Action Verb.

We build two Infrastructure-as-a-Service Platforms that Engineering and Marketing
professionals use to power their products and services.

Our products include <a href="https://brickftp.com/" target="_blank">BrickFTP</a>,
a hosted file sharing service for business, and
<a href="https://vaeplatform.com/" target="_blank">Vae Platform</a>,
a unique web hosting platform with an integrated CMS system.

Our company consists of 8 full time USA-based Engineers,
as well as sales and support outposts in France, Germany, and Latin
America.  We're looking to grow our family by one or two faces.

Our infrastructure platforms are used by over 2,000 enterprises and
SMBs, including Mozilla, Canonical, UPS, DirecTV, GoPro, Marriott, and
more.

We've been able to achieve the rare combination of high double-digit
annual growth and industry leading profitability.

We do it by aggressively recruiting the absolute best and brightest
engineers and structuring our company in a way that makes them want to
work here forever.

It's easy to say, but exceptionally hard to execute.  Here's how we do
it.

**We are one of the early adopters of <a href="http://www.holacracy.org/" target="_blank">Holacracy</a>**, a new style
of running an organization in a self-organizing manner that draws
inspiration from agile software development and lean manufacturing
processes.

Rather than hiring people for exactly one job description, we instead
look to find well rounded team members with skills in software
engineering, design, marketing, sales, and our other needs who are
interested in filling multiple roles within the organization.

**As a self-organizing team, our people have multiple roles and our role
descriptions are regularly updated via small iterations.**  As their
interests change and our needs change, the roles people fill change
dynamically over time.

*&quot;Most startups believe in iteration of their
products. Now they need to apply the same thinking to their
organizations.&quot;<br />&ndash; Adam Pisoni, Yammer co-founder & CTO*

Holacracy is not unstructured: you'll have a clear understanding of
your current roles and responsibilities, as well as a set of rules and
processes for changing those roles and responsibilities in real time.

Even though Holacracy is a lot to learn, we have a great onboarding
process and the rest of our team will guide you through your first few
months.  You'll also have the opportunity to attend a weeklong official
Holacracy training event at our expense.

We also practice Open Book Management, meaning that we share the exact
details of our Balance Sheet and P&L Statement with our entire team in
real-time, ensuring that **our staff has the data they need to treat the
business as if it were their own.**

**Our team members work from home and choose their own hours**, allowing
them to make time for family, recreation, vacations, or anything that is
important to them.

Every team member gets 10 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20
paid time off days intended to be used for vacations.  Go have fun.
Don't work all the time.

**Our team members also work hard, are constantly learning, and accomplish
a ton for the company in the time that they are working.**

Our team spends at least 12 days together face-to-face per year at four
quarterly meetings that are hosted all over the country.
We try to do these meetings in cities that are fun to visit.  In the
last few years, we've been to Austin, Orlando, Minneapolis, San Diego, Las
Vegas, New York City, and Detroit.

As you might expect from a company that is so open, we also post our
salary information right here in the job post.
**We will pay you $100,000 in your first year, plus a great benefits
package, and a $2,500 signing bonus to purchase a new computer.**

After your first year with Action Verb, we will update your salary based
on the value that you have been able to demonstrate for the company.
We continue to update salary levels every year.  It is possible to reach a
pay level of double the starting salary if you come in and absolutely crush it.

We fully pay for your health insurance (exact plan details depend on
your state of residence), and we'll pick
up the tab for 50% of your spouse or family if they wish to also join
the healthcare plan.  We want your family to be healthy.

We recognize that other companies may offer higher initial salary offers
or signing bonuses, but at Action Verb, **we know that for our ideal
candidate, the exact level of pay is just one criteria by which they
choose where to work.**  Our goal is to offer the greatest work
environment possible and pay people well enough to make it possible for
them to join the team.  Come learn our way of working, take on as many
roles as you can, and establish yourself as a valuable asset to us.
Then after your first year, we'll re-evaluate your salary and make sure
it's more than fair, given the value you've been able to generate for
the company.

**We are looking for candidates who bring the following skills to the
table:**

 * Programming experience in several programming languages.  We are
particularly interested in Ruby, C++, Java, PHP, and Javascript.
 * Strong Computer Science background and understanding of algorithms and
data structures.
 * Solid web development skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  Even though
we have lots of backend work to keep several people busy, our business
is so web-facing that we think every engineer should be familiar with
web technologies.
 * Complete understanding of how to write secure code and an awareness of
common web application security vulnerabilities.
 * Appreciation for testing and the ability to write specs and unit tests
 * History developing and supporting actual applications that have seen
production usage with a large userbase.

Most of our best applicants have Computer Science (or similar) degrees
from a well-regarded university.  **Our best applicants also tend
to have at least 3-5 years experience** in a position with direct
responsibility for developing and supporting large production
applications.

**We believe that everyone in tt everyone in the company should have
programming skills.** Our customers are primarily engineers, and in order
to relate to them and support our products at the highest possible
level, we should all be engineers too.

**We believe that the best Engineers tend to be polyglots with a wide
variety of programming language experience.** We don’t hire for specific
programming language skills, but rather look for engineers who are
fluent in several programming languages. We want our staff to be
adaptable and ready to evolve to what’s next.

**We believe that allowing and supporting 100% remote work gives us
access to great people we wouldn't otherwise be able to hire.**  We tend
to hire folks who are later in their careers, which means they usually
have their family established somewhere.  By offering remote work, we
can hire the best people, no matter where they're located.

**We believe that the best way we can acquire top talent is by being an
amazing place to work.**  Work from home, travel with the team, and
surround yourself with top tier people at Action Verb.

working at Action Verb great.](https://actionverb.com/working-at-action-verb)

**We believe that building great infrastructure and platform products
requires a great internal infrastructure.** We have Continuous Integration,
a full staging environment, and considerable test coverage.
We built our own application deployment system.  We
self-manage our server environment on Amazon Web Services and custom hardware.

**We believe in using the right tool for the job.** Our core applications
are built in Ruby, JavaScript, Java, C++, and PHP. We use Rails, React,
Chef, Qt, Jenkins, Github, Honeybadger, CircleCI, Maven, AWS, MySQL,
Redis, Memcached, Haml, Sass, and many other exciting open source
systems. We don’t want to get stuck in the trap of using a language or a
tool just because "that’s how it’s done around here."

**We believe that engineers should support what they build.** We expect
our teammates to take responsibilty for the engineering decisions they
make.  If there are performance problems in production, nobody should
have to chase anyone down.  All engineers participate in a 24/7 on-call
rotation and all engineers speak to customers.

**We believe in building products that we actually use ourselves.** We are
our own toughest critics and we put all of our products through their
paces every day.

**Tell us about what you believe.** We only read cover letters in our first screening round, so make sure
yours counts.  In your cover letter, we'd like you to address the
following topics:

 * Why does this opportunity specifically appeal to you?
 * How well do you align with Our Core Beliefs?  Is there anything you would add or change?
 * Why would working remotely for Action Verb change your life for the better?
 * Are you familiar with Holacracy?  Any questions or concerns?
 * What's lacking in your current work arrangement that we could improve?
 * What are your philosophies on software development?
 * What does writing great software look like?
