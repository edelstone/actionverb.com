### For The Role of Designer, We Want To See This Track Record of Results:

 * Experience designing and supporting actual web applications that have seen
production usage with a large userbase.
 * Comprehensive understanding of UI/UX principles
 * Able to develop a marketing website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This position is designed to appeal to designers who are not afraid to
get their hands dirty writing code.  You will be working on web
applications, mobile apps, desktop apps, marketing websites, and email.

We expect to see an extensive portfolio that includes both static
websites and applications. We want our designers to be able to work on both
apps and brochure/marketing websites.

## Some of Our Core Beliefs

**We believe that everyone in the company should have programming
skills.** We want everyone here to be able to take their ideas and
bring them to life.  For designers, that means you have to be able to
write code.  It doesn't mean you have to be an expert, but you should at
least be able to implement intermediate-level jQuery and also work with
React.

**We believe that allowing and supporting 100% remote work gives us
access to great people we wouldn't otherwise be able to hire.**  We tend
to hire folks who are later in their careers, which means they usually
have their family established somewhere.  By offering remote work, we
can hire the best people, no matter where they're located.

**We believe that the best way we can acquire top talent is by being an
amazing place to work.**  Work from home, travel with the team, and
surround yourself with top tier people at Action Verb.

working at Action Verb great.](https://actionverb.com/working-at-action-verb)

**We believe that building great infrastructure and platform products
requires a great internal infrastructure.** We have Continuous Integration,
a full staging environment, and considerable test coverage.
We built our own application deployment system.  We
self-manage our server environment on Amazon Web Services and custom hardware.

**We believe that engineers should support what they build.** We expect
our teammates to take responsibility for the engineering decisions they
make.  If there are performance problems in production, nobody should
have to chase anyone down.  All engineers participate in a 24/7 on-call
rotation and all engineers speak to customers.

**We believe in building products that we actually use ourselves.** We are
our own toughest critics and we put all of our products through their
paces every day.
