### We're Bootstrapped, Profitable, and Growing

Our success comes from building great products and services that are
loved by our customers, and our growth comes from expanding and
improving our products as quickly as we can.

Building great products isn't easy and Action Verb just isn't the type
of place that is okay with mediocrity.  You need great people to build
great products.

So we're on a quest to find the smartest, most creative, and most
motivated technical people, and create for them an environment in which
they thrive.


### You Will Have Authority, Accountability, and Autonomy

We use <a href="http://www.holacracy.org/" target="_blank">Holacracy</a>, a
framework for running self-organizing teams that draws
inspiration from agile software development and lean manufacturing.

Our employees don't have a single job description. Instead, you will fill
many specific, focused roles that have very clear authority and accountabilities.

Some roles are big and some roles are small, but for every role you
fill, you will be the sole person with authority to make decisions for
the company.

There are no assistants, subordinates, or committees here.  You will
knows your authority and accountabilities, and take action.

Roles are created, changed, and removed as our business grows and
evolves, and the roles you fill as an employee may change often.

*&quot;Most startups believe in iteration of their
products. Now they need to apply the same thinking to their
organizations.&quot;<br />&ndash; Adam Pisoni, Yammer co-founder & CTO*

You will attend a 4-day onboarding course we've designed to teach you the
in's and out's of how this all works.  By the end of your onboarding,
you'll be more equipped to get things actually accomplished, deployed,
and implemented at Action Verb than you have ever been at a previous
employer.
