### Our Success Strategy

We've been able to achieve the rare combination of high double-digit
annual growth and industry leading profitability.

We do it by aggressively recruiting the absolute best and brightest
people and structuring our company in a way that makes them want to
work here forever.

It's easy to say, but exceptionally hard to execute.  Here's how we do
it.


### We Practice Holacracy

**We are one of the early adopters of <a href="http://www.holacracy.org/" target="_blank">Holacracy</a>**, a new style
of running an organization in a self-organizing manner that draws
inspiration from agile software development and lean manufacturing
processes.

Rather than hiring people for exactly one job description, we instead
look to find well rounded team members with skills in software
engineering, design, marketing, sales, and our other needs who are
interested in filling multiple roles within the organization.

**As a self-organizing team, our people have multiple roles and our role
descriptions are regularly updated via small iterations.**  As their
interests change and our needs change, the roles people fill change
dynamically over time.

*&quot;Most startups believe in iteration of their
products. Now they need to apply the same thinking to their
organizations.&quot;<br />&ndash; Adam Pisoni, Yammer co-founder & CTO*

Holacracy is not unstructured: you'll have a clear understanding of
your current roles and responsibilities, as well as a set of rules and
processes for changing those roles and responsibilities in real time.

Even though Holacracy is a lot to learn, we have a great onboarding
process and the rest of our team will guide you through your first few
months.  You'll also have the opportunity to attend a weeklong official
Holacracy training event at our expense.
