Hi!  We're Action Verb.

We build two Infrastructure-as-a-Service Platforms that empower
organizations worldwide.

Our products include <a href="https://brickftp.com/" target="_blank">BrickFTP</a>,
a hosted file sharing service for business, and
<a href="https://vaeplatform.com/" target="_blank">Vae Platform</a>,
a unique web hosting platform with an integrated CMS system.

Our company consists of {{ site.team_size }} (but growing to {{ site.team_future_size }}
by the end of the year)
full time USA-based staff, as well as sales and support outposts in
France, Germany, and Latin America.

Our infrastructure platforms are used by over 2,000 enterprises and
SMBs, including Mozilla, Canonical, UPS, DirecTV, GoPro, Marriott, and
more.
