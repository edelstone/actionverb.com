past, do not bother applying.


## Our Core Beliefs

**We believe that everyone in the company should have coding
skills.** We want everyone here to be able to take their ideas and
bring them to life.  For a marketer, that means you have to be able to
buuld webpages.  It doesn't mean you have to be an expert, but you
should be able to implement a landing page that looks good.  Adding
Javascript tracking code to a page shouldn't scare you.

**We believe that allowing and supporting 100% remote work gives us
access to great people we wouldn't otherwise be able to hire.**  We tend
to hire folks who are later in their careers, which means they usually
have their family established somewhere.  By offering remote work, we
can hire the best people, no matter where they're located.

**We believe that the best way we can acquire top talent is by being an
amazing place to work.**  Work from home, travel with the team, and
surround yourself with top tier people at Action Verb.

**We believe that selling to businesses and government entities is very
different from selling to consumers.**  Asking someone to buy a product is
a smaller ask than asking that person to become an advocate for that product
inside a company that may have a complicated purchasing process.  We're
looking for marketers who understand this distinction and have
experience empowering leads to become internal advocates for products.

**We believe that Sales and Marketing are not the same thing.**  This is
a marketing position, and you will be supported by three full time sales
agents who will handle the actual phone and email interactions with our
prospects.  Of course, we'd love to have you develop sales funnels that
are as automated as possible, but I want to be clear that this is a
Marketing job, not a Sales job.

**We believe that the things Cialdini writes about in /Influence/ really
do make a difference.** There is art to marketing, but it is mostly a
science.  The process has been well studied and documented.  If you're
the right candidiate for this job, you'll be well-studied on these
matters and already know what to do to take our marketing to the next level.
