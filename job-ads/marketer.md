**"VP of Marketing" For Holacracy-Powered 14-Person All-Remote SaaS Company**

Hi!  We're Action Verb.

We build two Infrastructure-as-a-Service Platforms that Engineering and Marketing
professionals use to power their products and services.

Our products include <a href="https://brickftp.com/" target="_blank">BrickFTP</a>,
a hosted file sharing service for business, and
<a href="https://vaeplatform.com/" target="_blank">Vae Platform</a>,
a unique web hosting platform with an integrated CMS system.

Our company consists of 12 (soon to be 16) full time USA-based staff,
as well as sales and support outposts in France, Germany, and Latin
America.

I apologize for the misleading title, beacuse we don't actually use
titles like Vice President, but that's the type of role we're looking to
hire for here.  We're looking for someone who can take responsibility
for the marketing our two SaaS products.

Our infrastructure platforms are used by over 2,000 enterprises and
SMBs, including Mozilla, Canonical, UPS, DirecTV, GoPro, Marriott, and
more.

We've been able to achieve the rare combination of high double-digit
annual growth and industry leading profitability.

We do it by aggressively recruiting the absolute best and brightest
engineers and structuring our company in a way that makes them want to
work here forever.

It's easy to say, but exceptionally hard to execute.  Here's how we do
it.

**We are one of the early adopters of <a href="http://www.holacracy.org/" target="_blank">Holacracy</a>**, a new style
of running an organization in a self-organizing manner that draws
inspiration from agile software development and lean manufacturing
processes.

Rather than hiring people for exactly one job description, we instead
look to find well rounded team members with skills in software
engineering, design, marketing, sales, and our other needs who are
interested in filling multiple roles within the organization.

(That's why we don't actually use titles like "VP".)

**As a self-organizing team, our people have multiple roles and our role
descriptions are regularly updated via small iterations.**  As their
interests change and our needs change, the roles people fill change
dynamically over time.

*&quot;Most startups believe in iteration of their
products. Now they need to apply the same thinking to their
organizations.&quot;<br />&ndash; Adam Pisoni, Yammer co-founder & CTO*

Holacracy is not unstructured: you'll have a clear understanding of
your current roles and responsibilities, as well as a set of rules and
processes for changing those roles and responsibilities in real time.

Even though Holacracy is a lot to learn, we have a great onboarding
process and the rest of our team will guide you through your first few
months.  You'll also have the opportunity to attend a weeklong official
Holacracy training event at our expense.

We also practice Open Book Management, meaning that we share the exact
details of our Balance Sheet and P&L Statement with our entire team in
real-time, ensuring that **our staff has the data they need to treat the
business as if it were their own.**

**Our team members work from home and choose their own hours**, allowing
them to make time for family, recreation, vacations, or anything that is
important to them.

Every team member gets 10 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20
paid time off days intended to be used for vacations.  Go have fun.
Don't work all the time.

**Our team members also work hard, are constantly learning, and accomplish
a ton for the company in the time that they are working.**

Our team spends at least 18 days together face-to-face per year at six
in-person meetings spread out through the year and hosted all over the country.
We try to do these meetings in cities that are fun to visit.  In the
last few years, we've been to Austin, Orlando, Minneapolis, San Diego, Las
Vegas, New York City, Detroit, and Fort Lauderdale.

As you might expect from a company that is so open, we also post our
salary information right here in the job post.
**We will pay you $100,000 in your first year, plus a great benefits
package, and a $2,500 signing bonus to purchase a new computer.**

After your first year with Action Verb, we will update your salary based
on the value that you have been able to demonstrate for the company.
We continue to update salary levels every year.  It is possible to reach a
pay level of double the starting salary if you come in and absolutely crush it.

We fully pay for your health insurance (exact plan details depend on
your state of residence), and we'll pick
up the tab for 50% of your spouse or family if they wish to also join
the healthcare plan.  We want your family to be healthy.

We recognize that other companies may offer higher initial salary offers
or signing bonuses, but at Action Verb, **we know that for our ideal
candidate, the exact level of pay is just one criteria by which they
choose where to work.**  Our goal is to offer the greatest work
environment possible and pay people well enough to make it possible for
them to join the team.  Come learn our way of working, take on as many
roles as you can, and establish yourself as a valuable asset to us.
Then after your first year, we'll re-evaluate your salary and make sure
it's more than fair, given the value you've been able to generate for
the company.

**This position is for marketers who are hands-on.  This job will not
involve dealing with any third party agencies.**

You will be managing our advertising yourself.  You will write headlines
and body copy.  You will design and implement landing pages and funnels.

You will develop lead magnets (such as white papers, PDFs, free tools,
and giveaways.)

**We are looking for candidates who bring the following skills to the
table:**

 * Proven track record growing B2B SaaS services using Internet Marketing techniques, preferably in a lead role.
 * Significant experience working with online advertising platforms including Adwords, display networks, Facebook, and RTB systems
 * History of managing online advertising budgets of >$1M per year.
 * Ability to write ad copy, including an understanding of how to write headlines and how to write body copy
 * Comprehensive knowledge of conversion optimization techniques and experience developing, implementing, and analyzing split tests
 * Proficiency with statistics and an ability to understand statistical significance as it applies to tests
 * Experience building diverse campaigns to target potential buyers at various stages of the funnel
 * Familiarity with the advanced features of Google Analytics and other software for analyzing the performance of the individual components of our funnel
 * Ability to build web pages in raw HTML
 * Photoshop experience preferred
 * Experience developing and promoting "lead magnets" such as white papers, free tools, etc.

The experience requirements are firm.

If you have not run a B2B SaaS marketing campaign in the past, do not
bother applying.  If you have not managed a 7-figure ad budget in the
past, do not bother applying.

**We believe that everyone in the company should have coding
skills.** We want everyone here to be able to take their ideas and
bring them to life.  For a marketer, that means you have to be able to
buuld webpages.  It doesn't mean you have to be an expert, but you
should be able to implement a landing page that looks good.  Adding
Javascript tracking code to a page shouldn't scare you.

**We believe that allowing and supporting 100% remote work gives us
access to great people we wouldn't otherwise be able to hire.**  We tend
to hire folks who are later in their careers, which means they usually
have their family established somewhere.  By offering remote work, we
can hire the best people, no matter where they're located.

**We believe that the best way we can acquire top talent is by being an
amazing place to work.**  Work from home, travel with the team, and
surround yourself with top tier people at Action Verb.

working at Action Verb great.](https://actionverb.com/working-at-action-verb)

**We believe that selling to businesses and government entities is very
different from selling to consumers.**  Asking someone to buy a product is
a smaller ask than asking that person to become an advocate for that product
inside a company that may have a complicated purchasing process.  We're
looking for marketers who understand this distinction and have
experience empowering leads to become internal advocates for products.

**We believe that Sales and Marketing are not the same thing.**  This is
a marketing position, and you will be supported by three full time sales
agents who will handle the actual phone and email interactions with our
prospects.  Of course, we'd love to have you develop sales funnels that
are as automated as possible, but I want to be clear that this is a
Marketing job, not a Sales job.

**We believe that the things Cialdini writes about in /Influence/ really
do make a difference.** There is art to marketing, but it is mostly a
science.  The process has been well studied and documented.  If you're
the right candidiate for this job, you'll be well-studied on these
matters and already know what to do to take our marketing to the next level.

**Tell us about what you believe.** We only read cover letters in our first screening round, so make sure
yours counts.  In your cover letter, we'd like you to address the
following topics:

 * Why does this opportunity specifically appeal to you?
 * How well do you align with Our Core Beliefs?  Is there anything you would add or change?
 * Why would working remotely for Action Verb change your life for the better?
 * Are you familiar with Holacracy?  Any questions or concerns?
 * What's lacking in your current work arrangement that we could improve?
 * Who are your role models with regard to copywriting and messaging?
 * What does a great paid traffic campaign for a B2B product look like and where do you expect the best traffic to come from?
 * What does a good A/B testing strategy look like?
