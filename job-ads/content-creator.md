## Marketing Content Creator For {{ site.team_size }}-Person All-Remote Software Company

Are you a technically-minded writer (or a coder with a passion for
writing) with experience creating marketing content for a technical
audience?  Have you crafted case studies and whitepapers that have sold
software products?  If so, we'd like you to learn about Action Verb!

{% include_relative header-1.md %}

For example, as a Marketing Content Creator, you'll be
making all the decisions yourself:  what to write about, who to feature,
and even what publishing platform to use.  You will not be micromanaged!

### For The Role of Content Creator, We're Looking For Someone With This Track Record Of Results:

 * Personally written a wide variety of engaging marketing, brochure, or blog-type content in the high-tech or software niche.
 * Personally written case studies and/or whitepapers for the purpose of
 selling software or other high-tech products.

## Some of Our Core Beliefs

**We believe that everyone in the company should have coding
skills.** We want everyone here to be able to take action to get things
done.  Adding JavaScript tracking code to a page shouldn't scare you.
If you need to implement your own click and converstion tracking on
a platform that doesn't provide it natively, you should be able to do
so.

**We believe that allowing and supporting 100% remote work gives us
access to great people we wouldn't otherwise be able to hire.**  We tend
to hire folks who are later in their careers, which means they usually
have their family established somewhere.  By offering remote work, we
can hire the best people, no matter where they're located.

**We believe that the best way we can acquire top talent is by being an
amazing place to work.**  Work from home, travel with the team, and
surround yourself with top tier people at Action Verb.

**We believe that the things Cialdini writes about in Influence really
do make a difference.** There is art to marketing, but it is mostly a
science.  The process has been well studied and documented.  If you're
the right candidiate for this job, you'll be well-studied on the art and
science of driving paid traffic.
