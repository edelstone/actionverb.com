### We Are A Remote Company

You will work from home and have some flexibility to choose your
working hours, allowing you to make time for family, recreation,
vacations, or anything that is important to you.

You'll take off 10 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20
days of PTO for vacations.  Go have fun.  Don't work all the time.

Every quarter, you'll travel to an in-person meeting with the entire
teami to meet and work together face to face.  These meetings are in
cities that are fun to visit.  In the last few years, we've been to
Austin, Orlando, Phoenix, San Diego, Las Vegas, New York City,
and Fort Lauderdale.


## Results-Based Hiring

To abuse a sports metaphor, think of Action Verb is as major-league team.
Just like an NFL or NBA team has a limited number of picks in the
draft, we only have a small number of slots available for new employees,
and we want to maximize the chance that the people we draft have the
highest possible chance of producing results for the team.

So just like getting a job in the NFL, getting a job at Action Verb
starts with your stats.

When we need to fill a role, we look for people with a track record of
success filling a similar role.

We do not hire interns, junior staff, or anyone with less than 3
years of experience directly related to the role.

As a result, at Action Verb, all your co-workers will be major-league
players, and you will relate to everyone here as a peer.
