We also practice Open Book Management, meaning that we share the exact
details of our Balance Sheet and P&L Statement with our entire team in
real-time, ensuring that **our staff has the data they need to treat the
business as if it were their own.**

**Our team members work from home and choose their own hours**, allowing
them to make time for family, recreation, vacations, or anything that is
important to them.

Every full-time team member gets 10 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20
paid time off days intended to be used for vacations.  Go have fun.
Don't work all the time.

**Our team members also work hard, are constantly learning, and accomplish
a ton for the company in the time that they are working.**

Our team spends at least 12 days together face-to-face per year at four
to six in-person meetings spread out through the year and hosted all over the country.
We try to do these meetings in cities that are fun to visit.  In the
last few years, we've been to Austin, Orlando, Minneapolis, San Diego, Las
Vegas, New York City, Detroit, and Fort Lauderdale.
