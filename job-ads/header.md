Hi!  We're Action Verb.

We build two Infrastructure-as-a-Service Platforms that empower
organizations worldwide.

Our products include <a href="https://brickftp.com/" target="_blank">BrickFTP</a>,
a hosted file sharing service for business, and
<a href="https://vaeplatform.com/" target="_blank">Vae Platform</a>,
a unique web hosting platform with an integrated CMS system.

Our company consists of {{ site.team_size }} (but growing to {{ site.team_future_size }}
by the end of the year)
full time USA-based staff, as well as sales and support outposts in
France, Germany, and Latin America.

Our infrastructure platforms are used by over 2,000 enterprises and
SMBs, including Mozilla, Canonical, UPS, DirecTV, GoPro, Marriott, and
more.


### Our Success Strategy

We've been able to achieve the rare combination of high double-digit
annual growth and industry leading profitability.

We do it by aggressively recruiting the absolute best and brightest
people and structuring our company in a way that makes them want to
work here forever.

It's easy to say, but exceptionally hard to execute.  Here's how we do
it.


### We Practice Holacracy

**We are one of the early adopters of <a href="http://www.holacracy.org/" target="_blank">Holacracy</a>**, a new style
of running an organization in a self-organizing manner that draws
inspiration from agile software development and lean manufacturing
processes.

Rather than hiring people for exactly one job description, we instead
look to find well rounded team members with skills in software
engineering, design, marketing, sales, and our other needs who are
interested in filling multiple roles within the organization.

**As a self-organizing team, our people have multiple roles and our role
descriptions are regularly updated via small iterations.**  As their
interests change and our needs change, the roles people fill change
dynamically over time.

*&quot;Most startups believe in iteration of their
products. Now they need to apply the same thinking to their
organizations.&quot;<br />&ndash; Adam Pisoni, Yammer co-founder & CTO*

Holacracy is not unstructured: you'll have a clear understanding of
your current roles and responsibilities, as well as a set of rules and
processes for changing those roles and responsibilities in real time.

Even though Holacracy is a lot to learn, we have a great onboarding
process and the rest of our team will guide you through your first few
months.  You'll also have the opportunity to attend a weeklong official
Holacracy training event at our expense.

We also practice Open Book Management, meaning that we share the exact
details of our Balance Sheet and P&L Statement with our entire team in
real-time, ensuring that **our staff has the data they need to treat the
business as if it were their own.**

**Our team members work from home and choose their own hours**, allowing
them to make time for family, recreation, vacations, or anything that is
important to them.

Every full-time team member gets 10 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20
paid time off days intended to be used for vacations.  Go have fun.
Don't work all the time.

**Our team members also work hard, are constantly learning, and accomplish
a ton for the company in the time that they are working.**

Our team spends at least 12 days together face-to-face per year at four
to six in-person meetings spread out through the year and hosted all over the country.
We try to do these meetings in cities that are fun to visit.  In the
last few years, we've been to Austin, Orlando, Minneapolis, San Diego, Las
Vegas, New York City, Detroit, and Fort Lauderdale.
