### We're Bootstrapped, Profitable, and Growing

Our success comes from building great products and services that are
loved by our customers, and our growth comes from expanding and
improving our products as quickly as we can.

We believe that great products can only be built by great people.
So we're on a quest to find the smartest, most creative, and most
motivated technical people, and create an environment in which
they thrive.


### You Will Have Authority, Accountability, and Autonomy

At Action Verb, we run our business using <a href="http://www.holacracy.org/" target="_blank">Holacracy</a>, a
framework for running self-organizing teams that draws
inspiration from agile software development and lean manufacturing.

Our employees don't have a single job description. Instead, you will fill
many specific, focused roles that have very clear authority and accountabilities.

Some roles are big and some roles are small, but every role has a
defined area of authority belonging exclusively to that role.
