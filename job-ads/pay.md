## Salary and Pay

As you might expect from a company that is so open, we also post our
salary information right here in the job post.
**We will pay you $100,000 in your first year, plus a great benefits
package, and a $2,500 signing bonus to purchase a new computer.**

After your first year with Action Verb, we will update your salary based
on the value that you have been able to demonstrate for the company.
We continue to update salary levels every year.  It is possible to reach a
pay level of double the starting salary if you come in and absolutely crush it.

We fully pay for your health insurance (exact plan details depend on
your state of residence), and we'll pick
up the tab for 50% of your spouse or family if they wish to also join
the healthcare plan.  We want your family to be healthy.

We recognize that other companies may offer higher initial salary offers
or signing bonuses, but at Action Verb, **we know that for our ideal
candidate, the exact level of pay is just one criteria by which they
choose where to work.**  Our goal is to offer the greatest work
environment possible and pay people well enough to make it possible for
them to join the team.  Come learn our way of working, take on as many
roles as you can, and establish yourself as a valuable asset to us.
Then after your first year, we'll re-evaluate your salary and make sure
it's more than fair, given the value you've been able to generate for
the company.

**Plus, you can join Action Verb Risk Free because of our $7,500
Quitting Bonus Within Your First 90 Days.**

We get it.  Holacracy is new.  Working remote is hard.  We love these
things about our culture, but you might not be sure if you do.  Or maybe
you just don't trust us that we really do embody the Core Beliefs on
this webpage.  To our prospects who may be on the fence about joining
Action Verb, we want to make one more offer to push you over the edge
and convince you to join us.

If you don't like working at Action Verb for any reason, quit within the
first 90 days and receive a $7,500 quitting bonus.  That should be
enough to keep you and your family afloat while you decide on your next
path.  We hope that you won't take us up on the offer, but we want you
to feel good knowing that it's there.
