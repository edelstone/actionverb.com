 * Solid web development frontend skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS,
including ES5, JSX, Sass, and React.js.
 * Experience building and delivering React.js applications that have seen
actual production usage.
 * Familiarity with building classic Ruby on Rails UIs (server-side
rendered views) is a strong plus.
 * A sense of good UX principles (though you will not necessarily be
expected to design.  We have amazing designers on staff.)
 * Firm understanding of how to write secure frontend code and an awareness
of common web application security vulnerabilities.
 * Testing and the ability to write unit tests/specs (we use popular JavaScript testing
frameworks)
 * Ability to prioritize and make decisions without needing to be
micromanaged
 * History developing actual SaaS applications that have seen production
usage with real customers.
 * Truly interested in giving our customers a great experience and able to
communicate directly with customers and prospects

Most of our best applicants have Computer Science (or similar) degrees
from a well-regarded university.  **Our best applicants also tend
to have at least 3-5 years experience** in a position with direct
responsibility for developing and supporting large production
applications.


## Our Core Beliefs

**We believe that everyone in tt everyone in the company should have
programming skills.** Our customers are primarily engineers, and in order
to relate to them and support our products at the highest possible
level, we should all be engineers too.

**We believe that the best Engineers tend to be polyglots with a wide
variety of programming language experience.** We don’t hire for specific
programming language skills, but rather look for engineers who are
fluent in several programming languages. We want our staff to be
adaptable and ready to evolve to what’s next.

**We believe that allowing and supporting 100% remote work gives us
access to great people we wouldn't otherwise be able to hire.**  We tend
to hire folks who are later in their careers, which means they usually
have their family established somewhere.  By offering remote work, we
can hire the best people, no matter where they're located.

**We believe that the best way we can acquire top talent is by being an
amazing place to work.**  Work from home, travel with the team, and
surround yourself with top tier people at Action Verb.

working at Action Verb great.](https://actionverb.com/working-at-action-verb)

**We believe that building great infrastructure and platform products
requires a great internal infrastructure.** We have Continuous Integration,
a full staging environment, and considerable test coverage.
We built our own application deployment system.  We
self-manage our server environment on Amazon Web Services and custom hardware.

**We believe in using the right tool for the job.** Our core applications
are built in Ruby, JavaScript, Java, C++, and PHP. We use Rails, React,
Chef, Qt, Jenkins, Github, Honeybadger, CircleCI, Maven, AWS, MySQL,
Redis, Memcached, Haml, Sass, and many other exciting open source
systems. We don’t want to get stuck in the trap of using a language or a
tool just because "that’s how it’s done around here."

**We believe that engineers should support what they build.** We expect
our teammates to take responsibilty for the engineering decisions they
make.  If there are performance problems in production, nobody should
have to chase anyone down.  All engineers participate in a 24/7 on-call
rotation and all engineers speak to customers.

**We believe that open-source only works if companies give back.**  If you
work on any open-source projects during the course of your work at
Action Verb, you are encouraged to submit your improvements as a pull
request back to the upstream project.  And if you build something from
scratch while working here that’s generic and not related to our core
products, we want you to release that on GitHub too.  We’ll also pay
your travel costs to any conference where you can get a speaking gig.

**We believe in building products that we actually use ourselves.** We are
our own toughest critics and we put all of our products through their
paces every day.
