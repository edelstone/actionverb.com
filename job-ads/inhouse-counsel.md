## In-House Counsel For Holacracy-Powered {{ site.team_size }}-Person All-Remote SaaS Company

{% include_relative header.md %}


## Accountabilities

Here are some of the things you'll be doing as an In-House Counsel at
Action Verb:

 * You'll create a more dynamic set of Services Agreements and Amendments, as
well as a set of internal procedures for how we handle requests to negotiate
the various points.

 * You will create policies for how we handle limitations of liability,
venue selection, service level agreements, indemnity, confidentiality,
data ownership, insurance requirements, and representations/warranties.

 * You will research how competing vendors handle these terms and become
familiar with 'industry standard' approaches, such as those adopted by
Microsoft, Amazon, Oracle, Salesforce, etc., and steer our legal
operations in a direction that is as industry-standard as possible.

 * You will determine whether it's ever advantageous to use a
customer-provided services agreement and if so, you will make sure that
our preferred terms are included as best as possible.

 * You will be the primary point of contact for the legal teams of our
customers and prospects, and you will work closely with our Sales
department to close deals.  You'll handle red-lining and back-and-forth
negotiations.

 * You will get on the phone with customers and prospects and persuade them
to see things our way, to the extent possible.

 * You will take responsibility for the
agreements between the Company and our Employees, as well as
responsibility for reviewing the agreements we sign with our vendors.

 * You will own and maintain all our published Policies, including our
Privacy Policy, EU Model Clauses, and HIPAA Business Associate
Agreements.

 * You'll take responsibility for our membership in US-EU Privacy Shield,
and other data protection programs.

 * You'll take responsibility for our set of liability insurance polices
and work to ensure that our coverage best reflects the risks created by
the Services Agreements we enter into.

 * You will also become responsible for developing a set of marketing
materials we can provide to our Sales team and publish on our website
that highlight our ability to support the various types of legal and
insurance requirements that our customers may have.

 * You will evaluate and respond to and subpoenas we may receive for
customer data.  (This has only happened once in our history, but
as we grow, we expect that it will happen more.)

 * ... and anything else that you feel fits within the purpose of keeping the company compliant
with legal requirements and protecting the company from legal threats.


## Qualifications

We are looking for applicants who meet the following qualifications:

 * JD degree from an accredited law school
 * Licensed to practiced law in the U.S. and in good standing with the bar in at least one state.
 * 2+ years experience with technology transactions in a corporate or well-regarded law-firm environment
 * Experience with at least some of the regulations that may apply to technology service providers, such as GLBA, FERPA, HIPAA, HITECH, ITAR, IRS 1075, EU Data Protection Directive, EU Model Clauses, US-EU Privacy Shield, UK DPA, and other foreign Privacy Acts.
 * Understanding of the range of accepted industry standards for commonly negotiated points in technology services contracts, including limitations of liability, venue selection, service level agreements, indemnity, confidentiality, data ownership, insurance requirements, and representations/warranties.
 * Desire to work in a fast-paced startup environment where if something
 you need doesn't exist, you are expected to build it!


## Some of our Core Beliefs

**We believe that recruiting and hiring top talent is very hard.** Our success depends on finding the best engineers out there, so we've invested heavily in our recruiting and interviewing processes. Making our next hire even better than the last is one of our highest priorities.

**We believe that allowing and supporting 100% remote work gives us
access to great people we wouldn't otherwise be able to hire.**  We tend
to hire folks who are later in their careers, which means they usually
have their family established somewhere.  By offering remote work, we
can hire the best people, no matter where they're located.

**We believe that remote work is actually harder than in-office work.** The biggest challenge that we experience with a remote team is keeping everyone in sync. We lean heavily on tools like Slack and <a href="https://www.holaspirit.com/">holaSpirit</a> (a Holacracy-specific productivity tool), and we are in the process of building our own project and action management system that conforms exactly to our processes.

**We believe that the best way we can acquire top talent is by being an
amazing place to work.**  Work from home, travel with the team, and
surround yourself with top tier people at Action Verb.
