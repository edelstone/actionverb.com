<h2>Smart Creatives:  You've Found Your Home</h2>

<p>If you're an experienced and successful engineer, designer, salesperson, or marketer, we want you to join our team.</p>

<p>We will succeed as a company if, and only if, we find and hire the best talent.</p>

<p>We consider most positions to be engineering roles and expect that all applicants know how to code. Most of our best applicants have Computer Science (or similar) degrees from a well-regarded university.</p>

<p><strong>Our strongest applicants also tend to have at least 3-5 years of experience</strong> in a position with direct responsibility for designing, developing, marketing, selling, or supporting a software application with a large userbase.</p>

<p>Due to our size and the number of applications we receive, we have adopted a very tough screening process for new applicants. We only invite about 5% of applicants to an initial phone interview, and only about 10% of phone interviews lead to further conversations.</p>

<p>Working here isn't for everyone, but if you think it might be for you, please apply.</p>


<h2>Available Positions</h2>

<p>If you've read about <a href="holacracy">our Holacracy practice</a>, you know that we expect our staff to hold several roles in the company.  Therefore, we make hiring decisions and conduct interviews based on broad skillsets, rather than specific role assignments.</p>

<p>Each link below will take you to a standalone recruiting page that we've built to be shareable amongst people with the appropriate skillset.  We also post these links directly on job boards.  That means they all have some redundant background information about Action Verb and Holacracy that you've probably already read by now.  We ask your forgiveness for making you read it again.</p>
