<h2>Our Interview Process</h2>

<p>Recruiting and hiring is the most important thing we do. Our success depends on finding and hiring people who are truly A-players. To meet that objective, we've built a proprietary interview process that is very different from what you may be used to.</p>

<p>Our written application asks for very specific topics to be covered in your cover letter. We use these cover letters to select a large pool of candidates to move on to our telephone interview process, which is designed to very quickly separate the highest caliber candidates from the folks who are simply average or lack the specific experiences we need.</p>

<p>The interview is conducted by a senior engineer from the team, usually the company founder if he is available. Interviews are recorded and additional staff often participate. The interviewer will dive straight into a set of challenging questions that require both technical knowledge and creativity. We ask questions that we've customized to get a feel for the depth and breadth of your technical knowledge. The interview is very fast paced; you'll be expected to supply answers off the top of your head, without pausing to look anything up.</p>

<p>Our standards for this process are extremely high and <strong>only about 10% of interviewees will make it to the end of the phone interview.</strong> We end interviews as soon as it becomes clear that the decision will be a no-hire. If this happens to you, please don't take it personally; it's not necessarily a judgement about you, but rather of how well you fit with our current needs. You are welcome to re-apply at a later date.</p>


<h2>Interview Tips</h2>

<p>Here are some tips that should give you the best chance of success on our phone interview:</p>

<ul>
	<li>We will be testing your knowledge of a variety of different subjects. Knowledge is not the only thing we hire by, but it's the easiest thing to test quickly. We do not expect that you will know the answer to every question. If you can't formulate a great answer to a question, just say so, and we'll move on quickly. We have a limited amount of time, and we'd rather spend as much of it as possible on things <i>you do know</i> rather than dwelling on things you don't.</li>
	<li>We adapt our questioning in real time to challenge you on your answers. We also jump around from topic to topic very abruptly. Just roll with it and answer the followups as best as you can. If a followup causes you to want to change an earlier answer, by all means do so.</li>
	<li>Our interview also includes ideation / brainstorming type questions where you will be asked to craft solutions to very difficult or impossible problems. On these, we want to hear your best creative ideas, even if you know that they fall short of the ideal. It's actually best if you can explain exactly why your best ideas fall short of the ideal.</li>
	<li>We also enjoy role-playing questions where we give you an issue to troubleshoot and see how you would go about solving it. For these, we will continually change the circumstances to challenge you. Just keep rolling with the scenario as it evolves and continue to respond as best as you can. Feel free to make assumptions about the question being asked, as long as you state that you are doing so.</li>
	<li>We may not give a whole lot of real-time feedback about how the interview is going. But use this rule of thumb: if you're still on the phone with us, it's going well. We have no interest in continuing to talk to someone that we know we won't hire, so don't ever get discouraged or let yourself think the interview is going poorly. If we are jumping around from topic to topic randomly, it could be for any reason at all. Maybe we loved your answer, maybe we hated your answer, and maybe we just decided to move on. Again, if we're still talking to you, it's going well.</li>
	<li>There is no live coding element to our interviews, and there is nothing you need to study ahead of time. Just show up and be prepared to share the knowledge you have. The technical/challenge part of this interview lasts between 5 and 45 minutes, depending on how fast you go.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you make it through to the end, you will then have the opportunity to ask all the questions you'd like about the company and our culture and unique way of working. In fact, if you are offered a position, you will have the opportunity to speak to everyone on the team before you'll have to make a decision.</p>

<p><strong>We look forward to speaking to you!</strong></p>
