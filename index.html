<h2>We're Action Verb.</h2>

<p>We build platforms and infrastructure that engineering and marketing
professionals use to power their products and services. Our products include <a href="https://brickftp.com/">BrickFTP</a> and
<a href="https://vaeplatform.com/">Vae Platform</a>.</p>

<p>Our company consists of 7 full time USA-based Engineers,
as well as sales and support outposts in the U.S., Germany, and Latin
America.</p>

<p><b>Our infrastructure platforms are used by over 2,000 enterprises and
small businesses</b>, including Mozilla, Canonical, UPS, DirecTV, GoPro, Marriott, and
more.</p>


<h2>Our Success Strategy</h2>

<p><b>We've been able to achieve the rare combination of high double-digit
annual growth and industry leading profitability.</b></p>

<p>We do it by aggressively recruiting the absolute best and brightest
engineers and structuring our company in a way that makes them want to
work here forever.</p>

<p>It's easy to say, but exceptionally hard to execute.  Here's how we do
it.</p>


<h2>We Practice Holacracy</h2>

<p>We are one of the early adopters of <a href="http://www.holacracy.org/">Holacracy</a>, a new style of running an organization in a self-organizing manner that draws
inspiration from agile software development and lean manufacturing
processes.</p>

<p>Rather than hiring people for exactly one job description, we instead
look to find well rounded team members with skills in software
engineering, design, marketing, sales, and our other needs who are
interested in filling multiple roles within the organization.</p>

<p><b>As a self-organizing team, our people have multiple roles and our role
descriptions are regularly updated via small iterations.</b>  As their
interests change and our needs change, the roles that are filled change
dynamically over time.</p>

<blockquote>Most startups believe in iteration of their products. Now they need to apply the same thinking to their organizations.</blockquote>

<p>â€“ Adam Pisoni, Yammer co-founder &amp; CTO</p>

<p>We also practice Open Book Management, meaning that we share the exact
details of our Balance Sheet and P&amp;L Statement with our entire team in
real-time, ensuring that <b>our staff has the data they need to treat the
business as if it were their own.</b></p>
