<h2>We're Action Verb.</h2>

<p>We build platforms and infrastructure that engineers and marketing professionals use to power their services. Our products include <a href="https://brickftp.com/">BrickFTP</a> and <a href="https://vaeplatform.com/">Vae Platform</a>. Our infrastructure platforms are used by over 2,000 enterprise and small businesses, including Mozilla, Canonical, UPS, DirecTV, GoPro, Marriott, and more.</p>

<p>Currently we are 7 full time USA-based engineers, along with a team of sales and support staff in the U.S., Germany, and Latin America.</p>


<h2>Our Success Strategy</h2>

<p>We've been able to achieve the rare combination of high double-digit annual growth and industry leading profitability. We do it by aggressively recruiting the absolute best and brightest engineers and structuring our company in a way that makes them want to work here forever.</p>

<p>It's easy to say, but exceptionally hard to execute. Here's how we do
it:</p>


<h2>We Practice Holacracy</h2>

<p>We are one of the early adopters of <a href="http://www.holacracy.org/">Holacracy</a>, a new style of running an organization in a self-organizing manner that draws inspiration from agile software development and lean manufacturing processes.</p>

<p>Rather than hiring people for exactly one job description, we instead look to find well-rounded team members with skills in software engineering, design, marketing, sales, etc. who are interested in filling multiple roles within the organization.</p>

<p>As a self-organizing team, our people have multiple roles and our role descriptions are regularly updated via small iterations.</b> As their interests change and our needs evolve, the roles that are filled change dynamically over time.</p>

<h2>We Use Open-Book Management</h2>

<p>We also practice open-book management, meaning that we share the exact details of our balance sheet and P&amp;L statement with our entire team in real time, ensuring that our staff has the data they need to treat the business as if it were their own.</p>
