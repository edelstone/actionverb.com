<h2>We're Action Verb</h2>

<p>We build software platforms that organizations use as essential pieces of their operations. Our products include <a href="https://brickftp.com/">BrickFTP</a> and <a href="https://vaeplatform.com/">Vae Platform</a>, which have over 2,000 enterprises, small businesses, and governmental entities as paying customers.</p>

<p>Our customers include Mozilla, Canonical, UPS, DirecTV, GoPro, Marriott, and more.</p>

<p>We are a {{ site.team_size }}-person (and growing) USA-based team of engineers, and we operate worldwide, with a multi-national customer base.</p>

<p>We have server locations and sales and support personnel in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, and provide sales and support in 6 languages (and growing).</p>


<h2>Our Success Strategy</h2>

<p>We've been able to achieve a rare combination of high double-digit annual growth and industry leading profitability. We do it by aggressively recruiting the most motivated and highly skilled engineers and structuring our company in a way that makes them want to work here forever.</p>

<p>It's easy to say, but exceptionally hard to execute. Here's how we do it:</p>


<h2>We Practice Holacracy</h2>

<p>We are an early adopter of <a href="http://www.holacracy.org/">Holacracy</a>, a new style of running an organization in a self-organizing manner that draws inspiration from agile software development and lean manufacturing processes.</p>

<p>Rather than hiring people for exactly one job description, we instead look to find well-rounded team members with skills in software engineering, design, marketing, sales, and other areas, and are interested in filling multiple roles within the organization.</p>

<p>As a self-organizing team, our people have multiple roles and our role descriptions are regularly updated in small iterations.</b> As their interests and business needs change, the roles that are filled evolve dynamically over time.</p>

<h2>We Use Open-Book Management</h2>

<p>We also practice open book management, meaning that we share the exact details of our balance sheet and P&amp;L statement with our entire team in real time, ensuring that our staff has the data they need to act and make decisions as if the business was their own.</p>
