# Join Our Team

If you're an amazing systems engineer, developer, or designer, we want
you to apply to join Action Verb.

We will succeeed as a company if and only if we find and hire the best
engineers.  We consider all positions to be engineering roles and expect
that all applicants know how to code.

Most of our best applicants have Computer Science (or similar) degrees
from a well-regarded 4-year university.  Our best applicants also tend
to have at least 3-5 years experience being in a position with direct
responsibility for designing, developing, or supporting a production
application with a large userbase.

Due to our size and the number of applications we receive, we have
adopted a very tough screening process for new applicants.  We only
invite about 10% of applicants to an initial interview, and only about
10% of people make it past that step.

Working here isn't for everyone.  But if you think it might be for you,
please read on.
