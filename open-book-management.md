# Open Book Management

We learned about the idea of Open Book Management from
the folks at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zingermanscommunity.com/about-us/">Zingerman's</a> in Ann Arbor, MI.

Zingerman's is a vertically integrated family of food businesses with revenues
in the high eight figures.  But their revenue isn't what impresses us about
Zingerman's.

What we find so amazing about Zingerman's is simply how much
fun everyone seems to be having and what an amazing work environment
they had created for their team.

Ask them how they do it, and they'll tell you that it's because of Open
Book Management.

Zingerman's has built a culture of radical transparency with regard to
financial books and company performance.  Every detail about the company
P&amp;L is shared at weekly meetings and posted on whiteboards for
everyone to see.  Every employee participates in setting revenue goals,
production goals, and cost goals, and then their progress toward those
goals is tracked in real time.

If the company is having a great week, there's no &quot;boss&quot; who
comes out and gives a congratulatory speech.  Everyone on the team already knows.

And similarly if the company is going through a rough patch, there's no
need to send out the management to give a pep talk.  The staff has
probably already come up with a plan to get things moving again.

Even though we don't have a physical office, we're endeavoring to
replicate the culture of Open Book Management that was pioneered by
Zingerman's.


## A Perfect Holacracy Companion

We see Open Book Management as a key addition to our Holacracy practice
that contributes to the success of our unique model at Action Verb.

Since we distribute real decision making authority to every person in
our organization, we'd better make sure that every single employee has
the data they need to make the best decisions possible.
