<h2>Our Philosophy</h2>

<p>Organizational success depends on hiring the best engineers and then keeping them. So, we've worked really hard to make Action Verb an ideal place to work. You can expect the following:</p>


<h2>Holacracy</h2>

<p><a href="holacracy">We practice Holacracy</a>, which means you don't have a boss. Your work is executed autonomously, without micromanagement. But Holacracy is not unstructured; you'll have a clear understanding of your current roles and responsibilities, as well as a set of rules and processes for changing those roles and responsibilities in real time.</p>

<p>Even though Holacracy is a lot to learn, we have a steadily-improving onboarding process with a lot of team support over your first few months. You'll also have the opportunity to attend a week-long official Holacracy training event at our expense.</p>


<h2>Top-Tier Talent</h2>

<p>We require a unanimous agreement from all team members before making a new hire. You should feel excited about the caliber of people you'll be working with.</p>


<h2>Work-Life Balance</h2>

<p>Our team members work from home and choose their own hours, allowing them to make time for family, recreation, vacations, or anything that is important to them. Everyone gets 10 company-wide holidays per year and 20 paid time off days intended for vacations. Go have fun. Don't work all the time.</p>

<p>In the time they are working, our team accomplishes a ton for the company. And they typically do everything they can to ensure the hours they work are in line with the company's needs.</p>


<h2>Pay</h2>

<p>We pay a starting salary of $60-70k for Support/Sales Engineers and $100k for Designers or Systems Engineers. We're usually able to match your current salary if you make more than that.</p>

<p>After your first year with Action Verb, we'll update your salary based on the value you've been able to demonstrate for the company. We continue to update salary levels every year. It is possible to reach a pay level of double the starting salary if you come in and absolutely crush it.</p>

<p>We also offer an annual bonus depending on performance and a signing bonus of $2,500 for you to purchase a new computer or other work equipment.


<h2>Benefits</h2>

<p>We fully pay for your health insurance (exact plan details depend on your state of residence), and we'll pick up the tab for 50% of your spouse or family if they wish to join your chosen plan. We want your family to be healthy.</p>

<p>Our benefits are provided through <a href="https://www.trinet.com/">TriNet</a>, which represents over 100,000 worksite employees and negotiates with insurance carriers on our behalf to get you the best rates and widest coverage options. If you don't like the specific healthcare plan we cover for your state, you can upgrade or downgrade to a different plan via TriNet's portal.</p>

<p>We recently added a 401(k) plan (no match yet, but soon) and plan to add employee stock options in the future.</p>


<h2>In-Person Meetings and Travel</h2>

<p>Our team spends at least 12 days together each year at four quarterly meetings that are hosted all over the country. We try to do these gatherings in cities that are fun to visit. In the last few years, we've been to Austin, Orlando, Minneapolis, San Diego, Las Vegas, New York City, and Chicago.</p>


<h2>Quitting Bonus</h2>

<p>We get it. Holacracy is new. Working remote is hard. We love these things about our culture, but you might not be sure if you do. Or maybe you just don't trust that we really do embody the core beliefs on this webpage. To our prospects who may be on the fence about joining Action Verb, we want to make one more offer to push you over the edge and convince you to join us.</p>

<p>If you don't like working at Action Verb for any reason, <strong>quit within the first 90 days and receive a $7,500 quitting bonus</strong>. That should be enough to keep you and your family afloat while you decide on your next path. We hope you won't take us up on the offer, but we want you to feel good knowing that it's there.</p>
