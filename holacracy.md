# Our Holacracy Practice

When Action Verb transitioned to an all-work-from-home company in 2009,
we knew we wanted to experiment with alternative structures for how we
organize our work.

We tried implementing a &quot;fully flat&quot; structure where there
were essentially no rules and no procedures.  It was liberating, but it
also didn't scale.  Surprise, surprise.

Then our founder read the excellent book
[Reinventing Organizations](http://www.reinventingorganizations.com/)
by Frederic Laloux and based on the reviews in the book and the
experiences at fellow Las Vegas-based outfit Zappos, we at Action Verb
decided to give Holacracy a try.

Here's Holacracy's official pitch from their website:

*Holacracy is a complete, packaged system for self-management in
organizations. Holacracy replaces the traditional management hierarchy
with a new peer-to-peer &quot;operating system&quot; that increases transparency,
accountability, and organizational agility.*

Holacracy combines the freedom of self-management with a detailed rule
set and a tested meeting process that allows us to actually distribute
real decision making authority to every employee in the company.

This means that every employee holds a leadership role and is empowered
to make meaningful decisions.

<div class="quote">&quot;In Holacracy, one of the principles is to make
the implicit explicit — tons of it is about creating clarity: who is in
charge of what, who is taking what kind of decision — and there is also
a system for defining that, and changing that, so it’s very flexible
at the same time.”<br />&ndash; Evan Williams Co-Founder, Twitter</div>
