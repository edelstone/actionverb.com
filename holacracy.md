# Our Holacracy Practice

After reading the book
[Reinventing Organizations](http://www.reinventingorganizations.com/)
by Frederic Laloux and based on the reviews in the book and the
experiences at fellow Las Vegas-based outfit Zappos,  we knew that
Holacracy was the management system we had been searching for.

**Holacracy is a complete, packaged system for self-management in
organizations.** Holacracy replaces the traditional management hierarchy
with a new peer-to-peer &quot;operating system&quot; that increases transparency,
accountability, and organizational agility.

Holacracy combines the freedom of self-management with a detailed rule
set and a tested meeting process that allows us to actually distribute
real decision making authority to every employee in the company.

This means that **every employee holds a one or more leadership roles and
is empowered to make meaningful decisions.**

<div class="quote">&quot;In Holacracy, one of the principles is to make
the implicit explicit — tons of it is about creating clarity: who is in
charge of what, who is taking what kind of decision — and there is also
a system for defining that, and changing that, so it’s very flexible
at the same time.”<br />&ndash; Evan Williams Co-Founder, Twitter</div>


## How Does Holacracy Actually Work?

Unless you've practiced it yourself, your preconceived notions about
Holacracy are probably pretty wrong.  Holacracy is not a &quot;flat
hierarchy&quot;, it's not &quot;no hierarchy&quot; and it's certainly
not anarchy.

Most basically, **Holacracy is a system to allow the organizational structure
of the company to be determined directly by the team** and to allow it to
change over time, via incremental changes.

At a weekly Governance Meeting, everyone has the opportunity to shape
the Roles in the company, including the Purpose of each Role and its
Accountabilities.  If a Role grows too big to be filled by a single type
of team member, it can be further differentiated into sub-Roles, much like
how a bodily organ is made up of different types of smaller cells.

When hired at Action Verb, you'll start in a single Role.  But you are
free at any time to express interest in another Role and if you take on
an additional Role, you will now be responsible for that Role's Purpose
and Accountabilities.

Roles can get pretty specific.
The more established team members at Action Verb hold 10-20 Roles each.


## The Holacracy Constitution

The exact rules of the Holacracy process are spelled out in <a
href="http://www.holacracy.org/constitution"
target="_blank">the Holacracy Constitution</a>, which is an open-source
document built by a team of contributors who collaborate via pull
requests on Github.

While the Constitution is a fascinating read, we recommend that you don't
make it your first reading material about Holacracy.  Reading the
Constitution from cover to cover would be like reading the NFL Rules
Manual when trying to learn about football.  Just like a better way to
learn football is to go watch a game, the best way to learn Holacracy is
to do it.  The Holacracy sponsoring organization offers <a
href="http://www.holacracy.org/events" target="_blank">training
events and introductory workshops</a> and we highly recommend those.  We
allow all of our team members to attend these training sessions and we
pick up the tab.

Another great resource for making sense of the Holacracy Constitution is
the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PF6QM6K/" target="_blank">book by the original author of the constitution</a>.

It's certainly not required that you understand any of this to apply for
a job at Action Verb, but if you accept one, we'll expect you to at
least read the book before you start.


## Our Founder and Shareholders Hold No Authority Other Than Through Holacracy

Probably the most surprising aspect of our Holacracy practice is our
high level of commitment to the Holacracy process.

**Our founder and shareholders have formally ceded their authority to
govern and run Action Verb except through the Constitution and its rules
and processes.**

This means that our Founder and Shareholders promise not to do anything
to side-step the Holacracy process and promise to protect the guarantees
provided by the Constitution.

Many companies treat their founder as some sort of mythical hero figure,
whose opinion is infalliable and must always be followed.  Our founder
specifically seeks to avoid this sort of treatment.  At Action Verb,
everyone has leadership authority through the Holacracy process, and you
can be assured that nobody will go out of process and mess with your
work.
