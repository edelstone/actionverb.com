# Our Holacracy Practice

We are one of the early adopters of <a href="http://www.holacracy.org/" target="_blank">Holacracy</a>, a new style
of running an organization in a self-organizing manner that draws
inspiration from agile software development and lean manufacturing
processes.

Rather than hiring people for exactly one job description, we instead
look to find well rounded team members with skills in software
engineering, design, marketing, sales, and our other needs who are
interested in filling multiple roles within the organization.

As a self-organizing team, our people have multiple roles and our role
descriptions are regularly updated via small iterations.  As their
interests change and our needs change, the roles that are filled change
dynamically over time.

<div class="quote">&quot;Most startups believe in iteration of their
products. Now they need to apply the same thinking to their
organizations.&quot;<br />&ndash; Adam Pisoni, Yammer co-founder & CTO</div>

We also practice Open Book Management, meaning that we share the exact
details of our Balance Sheet and P&L Statement with our entire team on a
regular basis.
