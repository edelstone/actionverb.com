# Our Core Beliefs

We are an opinionated company.  This is what we believe.


## On Hiring

**We believe that everyone in the company should have programming
skills.** Our customers are primarily engineers, and in order to
relate to them and support our products at the highest possible level,
we should all be engineers too.

**We believe that the best Engineers tend to be polyglots with a
wide variety of programming language experience.**  We don't hire for
specific programming language skills, but rather look for engineers who
are fluent in several programming languages.  We want our staff to be
adaptable and ready to evolve to what's next.

**We believe that the best way we can acquire top talent is by being an
amazing place to work.**  Work from home, travel with the team, and
surround yourself with top tier people at Action Verb.

**We believe that recruiting and hiring top talent is very hard**.  Our
success depends on finding the best engineers out there, so we've
invested heavily into our recruiting and interviewing processes.  Making
our next hire even better than the last is always one of our highest priorities.

**We believe that brainteaser interviews aren't very predictive.** Our
interview process is designed to test candidates' actual subject matter
knowledge of computer science without putting them through awkward
brainteasers.  We also believe in using role plays heavily during
interviews.

**We believe that every team member is welcome to participate in the
hiring process.** We require a YES from every interviewer that speaks to
a candidate and anyone on the team can become an interviewer.  We expect
this process to result in an ever-increasing caliber of new hires.


## On Management

**We believe that [Holacracy](/holacracy) is the best way to organize
the management of a company.** Holacracy replaces the traditional
management hierarchy with a new peer-to-peer "operating system" that
increases transparency, accountability, and organizational agility.  We
push real decision making authority down to each and every employee,
empowering everyone to drive the business as if it were their own.

**We believe in [Open Book Management](/open-book-management), which means that our staff knows
exactly how our finances work.** Since we distribute real decision
making authority to every person in our organization, weâ€™d better make
sure that every single employee has the data they need to make the best
decisions possible.


## On Working From Home

**We believe that allowing and supporting 100% remote work gives us
access to great people we wouldn't otherwise be able to hire.**  We tend
to hire folks who are later in their careers, which means they usually
have their family established somewhere.  By offering remote work, we
can hire the best people, no matter where they're located.

**We believe that remote work is actually harder than in-office work.**
The biggest challenge that we experience with a remote team is keeping
everyone in sync.  We lean heavily on tools like Slack and Holaspirit
(a Holacracy-specific productivity tool), and we are in the process of
building our own project and action management system that conforms
exactly to our processes.

**We believe that in-person interaction is key for a remote team.** Our
team spends at least 12 days together face-to-face per year in four
quarterly meetings that are hosted all over the country.


## On Security

**We believe that the need for cybersecurity is greater now than it
ever has been.** Cyberattacks have become more frequent and we expect
their frequency to continue to increase in the coming years.

**We believe that if a service is advertised as secure, it better be
secure against all known attacks**.  We set very high standards for the
products that we label as secure.  We don't just want to meet the
standards set forth by PCI and ISO, we want to do everything possible to
secure our customers' data.

**We believe that security is everyone's responsibility, even our
customers.** We resolve to keep our customers secure against evolving threats,
even if it means they might have to do some work on their end to keep up with
a changing security landscape.

**We believe that security policies, procedures, and controls are important.**
We get disgusted by companies that don't take seriously their documentation
of controls.  We commit to completing a third party audit of our security
controls by the end of this year.


## On Engineering

**We believe that building great infrastructure and platform products
requires a great internal infrastructure.** We have Continuous Integration,
a full staging environment, and considerable test coverage.
We built our own application deployment system.  We
self-manage our server environment on Amazon Web Services and custom hardware.

**We believe in using the right tool for the job.**  Our core applications
are built in Ruby, JavaScript, Java, C++, and PHP.  We use Rails, React,
Chef, Qt, Jenkins, Github, Honeybadger, CircleCI, Maven, AWS, MySQL,
Redis, Memcached, Haml, Sass, and many other exciting open source
systems.  We don't want to get stuck in the trap of using a language or
a tool just because &quot;that's how it's done around here.&quot;

**We believe that engineers should support what they build.** We expect
our teammates to take responsibilty for the engineering decisions they
make.  If there are performance problems in production, nobody should
have to chase anyone down.  All engineers participate in a 24/7 on-call
rotation and all engineers speak to customers.


## On Product

**We believe in building products that we actually use ourselves.** We are
our own toughest critics and we put all of our products through their
paces every day.

**We believe that our products will never be finished.**  The pace of
change in the world will never slow down.  It's our responsibility to
continue to evaluate how our products compete in the marketplace and to
evolve them to stay up to date.

**We believe that talking about features often takes longer than
building them in the first place.** We eschew long priotiziation
meetings, and just go build things as fast as we can.

**We believe that in many ways, the UX is the product.** A feature
is no good if nobody can find it or use it.  We commit to having great
UX and design that is both beautiful and functional.


## On Open Source

**We believe in using open-source tools and components wherever
possible.** We aren't afraid to go under the hood and make changes to
the open source packages that we use.  And indeed, we maintain an
internal patch set to just about every major open source codebase we
leverage.

**We believe that open-source only works if companies give back.**  We encourage
our engineers to contribute improvements to the open source projects we
use.  And if one of our staff agrees to speak at a conference, we pick
up the tab.  We encourage our staff to get out there and talk about what
they're up to.

**We believe that customers who build on top of our products shouldn't
experience vendor lock-in.** That's why we publish the full source code
to Vae Platform's rendering engine.  And we encourage our customers to
submit pull requests to us as well.


## Tell Us What You Believe

Are you an Engineer with an opinion?  Do our core beliefs resonate with you?

If so, we'd like you to [apply for a job with Action Verb](/now-hiring).

And that goes doubly so if you agree with *most* of the above, but think
there might be something we're missing.  These beliefs aren't gospel
handed down by the founder, they're a living breathing document and
we look for people who will help Action Verb grow and evolve.
