# Our Core Beliefs

We are an opinionated company.  This is what we believe.


## On Product

**We believe that our products will never be finished.**  We are committed
to continuously improving our customer experience.  We constantly reach
out to our customers to learn about new ways that we can help them get
their job done.


## On Hiring

**We believe that everyone in the company should have programming
skills.** Our customers are primarily engineers, and in order to
relate to them, we should be engineers too.

**We believe that the best Engineers tend to be polyglots with a
wide variety of programming language experience.**  We don't hire for
specific programming language skills, but rather look for engineers who
are fluent in several programming languages.  We want our staff to be
adaptable and ready to evolve to what's next.


## On Engineering

**We believe that building great infrastructure and platform products
requires a great internal infrastructure.** We have Continuous Integration,
a full staging environment, and considerable test coverage.
We built our own application deployment system.  We
self-manage our server environment on Amazon Web Services and custom hardware.

**We believe in using the right tool for the job.**  Our core applications
are built in Ruby, JavaScript, Java, C++, and PHP.  We use Rails, React,
Chef, Qt, Jenkins, Github, Honeybadger, CircleCI, Maven, AWS, MySQL,
Redis, Memcached, Haml, Sass, and many other exciting open source
systems.  We don't want to get stuck in the trap of using a language or
a tool just because &quot;that's how it's done around here.&quot;


## On Open Source

**We believe that open-source only works if companies give back.**  We encourage
our engineers to contribute improvements to the open source projects we
use.  And if one of our staff agrees to speak at a conference, we pick
up the tab.  We encourage our staff to get out there and talk about what
they're up to.


## Tell Us What You Believe

Are you an Engineer with an opinion?  Do our core beliefs resonate with you?

If so, we'd like you to [apply for a job with Action Verb](/now-hiring).

And that goes doubly so if you agree with *most* of the above, but think
there might be something we're missing.  These beliefs aren't gospel
handed down by the founder, they're a living breathing document and
we look for people who will help Action Verb grow and evolve.
