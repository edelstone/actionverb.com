# Our Core Beliefs

**We believe that building great products requires great
infrastructure.** We have Continuous Integration, a full staging environment, and almost
100% test coverage.  We built our own application deployment system.  We
self-manage our server stack on Amazon EC2 and custom hardware.

**We believe in using the right tool for the job.**  Our core applications
are built in Ruby, JavaScript, Java, C++, and PHP.  We use Rails, React,
Chef, Qt, Jenkins, Github, Honeybadger, CircleCI, Maven, AWS, MySQL,
Redis, Memcached, Haml, Sass, and many other exciting open source
systems.  We run Linux (Ubuntu) on our servers, but we support Linux and MacOS as
development environments.

**We believe that the best engineers tend to be polyglots with lots of
experience.**

**We believe that open-source only works if companies give back.**  If you
work on any open-source projects during the course of your work at
Action Verb, you are encouraged to submit your improvements as a pull
request back to the upstream project.  And if you build something from
scratch while working here that’s generic and not related to our core
products, we want you to release that on GitHub too.  We’ll also pay
your travel costs to any conference where you can get a speaking gig.

**We believe that our products will never be finished.**  We are committed
to continuously improving our customer experience.  We constantly reach
out to our customers to learn about new ways that we can help them get
their job done.
