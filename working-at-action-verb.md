# Working At Action Verb

Our success depends on hiring the best engineers and then keeping them.

So, we've worked really hard to make Action Verb an ideal place to work.


## Holacracy

At Action Verb, we practice [Holacracy](/holacracy), which means that
you don't have a boss.  Your work is executed autonomously, without micromanagement.

But Holacracy is not unstructured: you'll have a clear understanding of
your current roles and responsibilities, as well as a set of rules and
processes for changing those roles and responsibilities in real time.

Even though Holacracy is a lot to learn, we have a great onboarding
process and the rest of our team will guide you through your first few
months.


## Work-Life Balance

Our team members work from home and choose their own hours, allowing
them to make time for family, recreation, vacations, or anything that is
important to them.

Every team member gets 10 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20
paid time off days intended to be used for vacations.  Go have fun.
Don't work all the time.

But in the time that they are in and working, our team members work hard and accomplish
a ton for the company.


## Pay

We pay a starting salary of $60-70k for Support Engineers and
$100k for Designers or Systems Engineers.  If you currently make more
than that, we are usually able to match your current salary.

After your first year with Action Verb, we will update your salary based
on the value that you have been able to demonstrate for the company.
We continue to update salary levels every year.  It is possible to reach a
pay level of double the starting salary if you come in and absolutely crush it.

We also offer an annual bonus depending on performance and a signing
bonus of $2,500 for you to use to purchase a new computer.

We fully pay for your health insurance (exact plan details depend on
your state of residence), and we'll pick
up the tab for 50% of your spouse or family if they wish to also join
the healthcare plan.  We want your family to be healthy.

We expect to add 401(k) and employee stock ownership options in the
future.
